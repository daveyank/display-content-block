== Description ==

This plugin allows the WordPress user to display a content block or page as a widget along with the featured image for the respective block or page. It was built specifically to extend the Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget) plugin by vanderwijk, but it can be used as a standalone using pages in the widgets. 

I initially built this add-on plugin out of necessity for a client site where we needed to show a specific-sized featured image between the widget title and widget's content block. This plugin shows a drop-down of all available images sizes. Select the one to use in the widget, and adjust your site's CSS accordingly for specific styling options.

Visit http://www.vanderwijk.com/wordpress/wordpress-custom-post-widget/ for more information on the Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget) plugin.

Special thanks to vanderwijk for building a plugin that I use on a multitude of client websites.
